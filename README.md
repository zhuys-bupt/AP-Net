# AP-Net

This is the implementation of the paper **AP-Net: Attention-Fused Volume and Progressive Aggregation for
Accurate Stereo Matching**.

# How to use

## Environment
* python 3.6
* Pytorch >= 0.4.1

## Data Preparation
Download [Scene Flow Datasets](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html), [KITTI 2012](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_stereo_flow.php?benchmark=stereo), [KITTI 2015](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo)

## Training
**Scene Flow Datasets**

run the script `./scripts/sceneflow.sh` to train on Scene Flow datsets. Please update `DATAPATH` in the bash file as your training data path.

**KITTI 2012 / 2015**

run the script `./scripts/kitti12.sh` and `./scripts/kitti15.sh` to finetune on the KITTI 12/15 dataset. Please update `DATAPATH` and `--loadckpt` as your training data path and pretrained SceneFlow checkpoint file.

## Evaluation
run the script `./scripts/kitti12_save.sh` and `./scripts/kitti15_save.sh` to save png predictions on the test set of the KITTI datasets to the folder `./predictions`.
